# Description of your program (part 7)

Before starting to examine the document, start a word count at 0. Move past any spaces until reaching a character, then increase the 
word count by 1. Continue moving past characters until reaching another space without increasing the word count. If encountering the end of the document, stop the process. After 
reaching another space, repeat the process while the end of the document has not been reached. 

# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)

The previous exercise was similar to a homework assignment in the CS class I've taken before (CS142), which gave me a starting point but also meant I had to be careful because 
I couldn't assume I could copy everything from the Java program directly. Obviously it's easier to write a paragraph than a computer program, but writing this in english rather than
code means I can't check for any issues in my logic. Also, I'm not sure how Python would accomplish my instructions or where I would be likely to run into errors.

What I hope to get out of this class is some additional experience and confidence with coding.
